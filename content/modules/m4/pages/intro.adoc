## ABOUT THIS LAB

The _Travel Agency_ company have their _Travel Demo_ applications now running in a development and production environment operating within an Openshift Service Mesh. Now there is a new business opportunity for the Travel Agency, as a new Business partner wants to integrate the Travel API services with their own Solutions. The Travel Agency company needs to establish a secure way to expose the API Services for external partners.

== Requirements and constraints on integrating the new Business Partner

1. The new partner _Global Travel Organization(GTO)_ will source travel offers via _Travel Services Domain_ APIs.
2. The Travel Agency _Security Team_ requires all communications with the external client to be performed over `MUTUAL TLS`.
3. The Travel Agency _Platform Team_ wishes to enable further `authentication` with a valid JWT token in order to exercise possible `authorization` policies in the future.
